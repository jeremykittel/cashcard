## The TDD Cycle: Red, Green, Refactor
Test-Driven Development comprises three primary stages, often referred to as the TDD cycle: Red, Green, and Refactor.

1. Red: Write a failing test that describes the desired functionality.
2. Green: Implement the most straightforward code that makes the test pass.
3. Refactor: Clean up the implementation while ensuring all tests still pass.

These steps are repeated for every new feature, ensuring proper test coverage and adherence to best practices while minimizing technical debt.
